# Laptop Customizer
_Starter project for React course_

This project was a part of Thinkful's Engineering Immersion Program, Cohort 45. 

Given the original source code (in branch "Original") the task was to refactor the react app to utilize multiple components. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
